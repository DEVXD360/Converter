# Converter
JavaScript project to make conversions between different numerical systems.

## The Project
I create this project to master my javascript skills and made a simpler and nicer UI design than others websites.

Is built with pure Javascript and has a simple structure.

#### Currently the conversions support :
- Decimal (base 10)
- Hexadecimal (base 16)
- Octal (base 8)
- Binary (base 2)

### What are Number Systems?
A number system is a system representing numbers. It is also called the system of numeration and it defines a set of values to represent a quantity. These numbers are used as digits and the most common ones are 0 and 1, that are used to represent binary numbers. Digits from 0 to 9 are used to represent other types of number systems.

- Binary Number System:
The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The numbers in this system have a base of 2. Digits 0 and 1 are called bits and 8 bits together make a byte. The data in computers is stored in terms of bits and bytes. The binary number system does not deal with other numbers such as 2,3,4,5 and so on. For example: 10001base2, 111101base2, 1010101base2 are some examples of numbers in the binary number system.

- Octal Number System:
The octal number system uses eight digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 with the base of 8. The advantage of this system is that it has lesser digits when compared to several other systems, hence, there would be fewer computational errors. Digits like 8 and 9 are not included in the octal number system. Just as the binary, the octal number system is used in minicomputers but with digits from 0 to 7. For example: 35base8, 23base8, 141base8 are some examples of numbers in the octal number system.

- Decimal Number System:
The decimal number system uses ten digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 with the base number as 10. The decimal number system is the system that we generally use to represent numbers in real life. If any number is represented without a base, it means that its base is 10. For example: 723base10, 32base10, 4257base10 are some examples of numbers in the decimal number system.

- Hexadecimal Number System:
The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen digits/alphabets: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and A,B,C,D,E,F with the base number as 16. Here, A-F of the hexadecimal system means the numbers 10-15 of the decimal number system respectively. This system is used in computers to reduce the large-sized strings of the binary system. For example, 7B3base16, 6Fbase16, 4B2Abase16 are some examples of numbers in the hexadecimal number system.


### I build the project using :

- HTML : HTML technology is responsible for the structuring and placement of the data. It covers the way content is organized and where it is positioned on the page. It is the backbone.

- CSS : CSS is responsible for the representation of the data. It includes colors, fonts, background stuff, peculiarities of a layout, etc.

- JavaScript : If you want to add some interactivity, choose JavaScript. These things are controlled via libraries (such as jQuery, React.js, or Zepto.js) fitted into frameworks (for example, Ember, Backbone, or Angular).
